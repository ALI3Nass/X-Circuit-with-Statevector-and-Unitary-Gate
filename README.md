# X-Circuit-with-Statevector-and-Unitary-Gate

This repository contains examples of quantum computing using Qiskit, a Python framework for working with quantum circuits and simulating quantum systems. The code snippets provided demonstrate various quantum operations and simulations.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, make sure you have Qiskit installed. You can install Qiskit using the following command:

pip install qiskit

## Usage

The code snippets provided can be run in a Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment. Each code block showcases a specific quantum operation or simulation. You can copy and paste the code blocks into your environment to experiment with quantum computing using Qiskit.

Here's a breakdown of the code snippets:

- **Creating a Quantum Circuit**: Demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit with Qiskit and visualize it.
- **Applying Quantum Gates**: Shows how to apply quantum gates, such as the X gate, to the qubits in the circuit.
- **Simulating with Statevector Simulator**: Simulates the quantum circuit using the statevector simulator backend and obtains the statevector.
- **Visualizing the Bloch Vector**: Plots the Bloch vector representation of the obtained statevector.
- **Measuring Qubits and Counting**: Measures the qubit in the circuit, simulates the measurement results using the qasm simulator backend, and plots a histogram of the measurement counts.
- **Simulating Unitary Operator**: Demonstrates how to create a quantum circuit with a custom unitary gate using a unitary matrix, simulates the circuit, and obtains the resulting statevector.
- **Visualizing the Bloch Vector (Unitary Operator)**: Plots the Bloch vector representation of the obtained statevector for the circuit with the custom unitary gate.

Feel free to explore and modify the code snippets to experiment with quantum computing concepts using Qiskit.
